    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
An effective allocation of search effort is important in multi-objective optimization, particularly in many-objective optimization problems. This talk will discuss an adaptive search effort allocation strategy for MOEA/D-M2M for challenging Many-Objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs). This talk will introduce adaptively adjusts the subregions of its subproblems by detecting the importance of different objectives in an adaptive manner. More specifically, it periodically resets the subregion setting based on the distribution of the current solutions in the objective space such that the search effort is not wasted on unpromising regions. This talk will cover characterizes an imbalanced MOP by clearly defining properties and indicating the reasons for the existing EMO algorithms’ difficulties in solving them.
