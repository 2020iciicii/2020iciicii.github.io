    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
This talk focuses on security and privacy of cyber-physical systems from both the defender and the attacker's perspectives. Firstly, with the discrete-time Wirtinger's inequality, a distributed secure filter is designed for the system under Round-Robin protocol and deception attacks to guarantee the H infinity performance. Secondly, to make us have a better understanding of the attacker's possible behaviors, the optimal stealthy attack with respect to arbitrary detectors is designed and the effect of such attack, namely, reachable set, is analyzed. Finally, concerning the privacy preservation in distributed networks, a distributed dual averaging optimization algorithm with correlated perturbation mechanism is proposed, in which deterministic convergence is achieved and the privacy of individuals is protected.

Kun Liu received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and systems from Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, in 2012. From 2013 to 2015, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. In 2015, he held Researcher, Visiting, and Research Associate positions with, respectively, the KTH Royal Institute of Technology; CNRS, LAAS, Toulouse, France; and the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. In 2018, he was a Visiting Scholar with INRIA, Lille, France. In 2015 he joined the School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, where he is currently a tenured Associate Professor and Ph.D supervisor. His current research interests include networked control, game-theoretic control, and security and privacy of cyber-physical systems, with applications in autonomous systems. He has published 40 SCI papers, including 13 publications in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, and Automatica. He is the author of the monograph “Networked Control under Communication Constraints” (Springer, 2020). He currently serves as an Associate Editor for the IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information, and the Journal of Beijing Institute of Technology.
