    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
The elderly population around the world is constantly growing. With the shortage of qualified home healthcare professionals in many countries, especially in US, elderly care is becoming a significant societal problem. It is highly desirable to employ new technologies to promote the physical and mental well-being of older adults so they can age independently while enjoying high quality of life, which in the long run will greatly reduce the burden on family members and the healthcare industry. This talk will present the results of several NSF-funded projects in the Laboratory for Advanced Sensing, Computation and Control (ASCC Lab) at Oklahoma State University. These projects aim to develop a robotic health assistant called ASCCBot for home healthcare. Equipped with audio-visual sensors and powered by machine learning algorithms, the ASCCBot is capable of human behavior understanding and natural language conversation, enabling it to provide assistance and companionship to older adults who age in place. This talk will first introduce the companion robot-based smart home framework for home healthcare. It will then focus on human behavior recognition through sound data and human well-being assessment through natural language conversation. Next various companionship functions of the robotic assistant will be demonstrated. The talk will be concluded by discussing the future research directions of this new frontier.
