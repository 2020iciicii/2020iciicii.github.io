    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Artificial intelligence has been widely used in many fields to bring people many conveniences and great economic benefits. Hinton broke through the technical bottleneck of deep learning to lead the upsurge of deep learning. The rapid development of deep learning has promoted the development of artificial intelligence. The current study of deep learning focuses on the improvement of algorithm design and the introduction of new models, thus ignoring the cornerstone: hardware computing power. With the increase of massive data in the era of big data and the further increase of the deep learning network model, it is bound to put forward higher requirements for hardware computing power. In terms of hardware implementation, current computers are manufactured using conventional CMOS technology and suffer the inherent limitations due to miniaturization. The emergence of nanometer- size memristors in 2008 has led to the rapid development of brain-like computational chips. Memristors are characterized by their small size, analog storage, low powger consumption, and non- volatile characteristics, and are very suitable for constructing a flexible, adjustable, highly integrated deep learning network with simple structures. Therefore, this project is based on such ideas, studying the characteristics of memristors, exploring semi-supervised learning data sets processing techniques, designing improved deep learning algorithms, and implementing such algorithms by using memristive neural circuits, which are sufficient to support the training and application of large-scale deep learning networks.
