    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Everything in nature is eternal and absolute with time changing, while the static state is relative. Inspired by this fundamental law of nature and based on neural dynamics method, Dr. Zhijun Zhang designed and proposed a varying-parameter recurrent neural network. He designed and deduced various forms of the networks, and proved that the network has the property of super-exponential convergence in solving time-varying problems and robot motion planning problems. This model is more effective in suppressing noise when solving noisy problems and has many advantages. For instance, the network model can effectively overcome the limitations of existing methods in solving time-varying, nonlinear, underdetermined, and multi-solution problems in complex robotic systems, which can only be solved for specific types of robots with slow convergence and weak robustness, and has the advantages of high solution accuracy, fast error convergence, and strong robustness. This method can be applied to data analysis and mining, robot motion planning, natural human-robot interaction, flight controller design and many other aspects in real systems.
