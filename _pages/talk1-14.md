    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
In the past decades, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been shown to be capable of achieving high quality solutions to many hard optimization problems (e.g., NP-Hard problems). On the other hand, it is often criticized as having high computational cost, especially for large-scale problems. This drawback is becoming a major hurdle for EAsâ€™ applications in the real-world. This talk will present advances on making EAs more scalable in 3 most common circumstances, which aim at accelerating EAs significantly without deteriorate the quality of obtained solutions. In addition to general ideas and methodologies, case studies on vehicle routing, deep learning and social network analysis will also be given.
