    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
The localization and segmentation of the lesions in Medical image images is helpful for clinical diagnosis of the disease. The talk foucses on architectures on RDAU-NET (Residual-Dilated- Attention-Gate-UNet) model, RDAU_NET-WGAN and ADID-UNET that are employed to segment lesions. The model is based on the conventional U-Net, but the plain neural units are replaced with residual units oe dense networks to enhance the edge information and overcome the network performance degradation problem associated with deep networks. To increase the receptive field and acquire more characteristic information, dilated convolutions were used to process the feature maps obtained from the encoder stages. The traditional cropping and copying between the encoder-decoder pipelines were replaced by the Attention Gate modules which enhanced the learning capabilities through suppression of background information. The proposed models, are tested with BUS images and COVID 19 lung CT images and their segmentation results as compared to other Deep Networks. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed Hybrid-UNET models can accurately segment lesions when compared to other deep learning models and thus has a good prospect for clinical diagnosis.
