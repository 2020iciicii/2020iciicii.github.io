    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Industry 4.0 has revolutionized the modern manufacturing. Industrial robotics is one of the key enablers of industry 4.0. However current industrial robots are not intelligent enough to satisfy the needs for industry 4.0. Therefore new industrial robotics must be developed. Two manufacturing processes, robotic assembly and robotic welding, will be presented: (a) a modeling and optimization method for intelligent robotic assembly will be discussed; (b) welding parameter tuning is critical for quality weld. Intelligent robotic welding process will be presented. To make the production process run smoothly, a robot fault detection method will be discussed.
