    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
  Swarm intelligence is an important research field of artificial intelligence, and it is also the inevitable trend of the development of single agent intelligence. Inspired by the aggregation and emergence of biological swarm in nature, scholars at home and abroad are conducting research on swarm intelligence to improve the characteristics of swarm, such as large-scale and strong robustness. This report focuses on the generation and transformation of swarm under the control of gene regulatory networks. Gene regulatory network (GRN) is an efficient method to generate swarm formation. Under the control of gene regulatory network, the swarm can be deployed to track or entrap targets. By adding the cooperation between the swarm and the neighbors and obstacles in the task environment, the performance of the swarm in the target trapping task is effectively improved. The proposed network structure is demonstrated by simulations and experiments on Kilobots. Finally, the future development directions of the swarm are prospected from the task diversity, limited environment, task environment changes and other aspects.
