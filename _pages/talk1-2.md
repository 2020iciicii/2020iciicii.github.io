    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
  The aerial-surface cooperation has become a frontier and hotspot of the research on unmanned systems. It has a wide range of applications, e.g., search and rescue, forest fire fighting and danger detection. This report shows the various patterns of aerial-surface cooperation as well as its systematic taxonomy. Then, taking a typical aerial-surface cooperation system and its application in complex cooperation missions as an example, this report also presents a kind of new cooperative planning problems and their solutions.
