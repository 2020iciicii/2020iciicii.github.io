    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
In the construction of large-scale hydropower projects in China, enormous amounts of materials are consumed. Influenced by various factors, materials price fluctuates during the construction. To protect the benefits of both parties, reasonable material price adjustment methods need to be set in the procurement bidding documents. A price adjustment model is established considering price fluctuation stratifying and risk sharing. Aimed at the determination of parameters in the model, a simulation-based method is proposed in this paper, and the simulation process is optimized with the optimal computing budget allocation algorithm. Based on the actual data of a hydropower project in Sichuan province and the judgment of engineers, corresponding simulation case sets are generated and the calculation results are analyzed with TOPSIS. The experimental results show that the simulation-based method provides scientific and reasonable support for designing parameters of material price adjustment model, and the optimal computing budget allocation algorithm plays an optimizing role.
