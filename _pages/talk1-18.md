    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
With rapid development of communication systems such as 5G, the demand for superior performance electronic and photonic devices has been extremely high. Traditional devices might not meet the request of the fast grow of the communication technologies. With this context, many international researchers have turned their research and development focuses onto nanoscale materials and devices particularly with unprecedented discoveries on the topological effects and superconductivities. In this talk, a brief review on the state-of-the-art of the nanoscale materials and devices modulated with mechanical strains, which potentially demonstrate promising improvements on electronic and photonic properties is presented. As well as discussions on the applications of those strain modulated nanomaterials and devices will be made on this conference. The presentation is expected to serve as a stimulator to promote future novel research and development on this ever- intriguing topic.
