    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
There may exist more than one Pareto optimal solution with the same objective vector to a multi- modal multi-objective optimization problem (MMOP). The difficulties in finding such solutions can be different. Existing evolutionary multi-modal multi-objective algorithms are unable to solve such an MMOP due to their convergence-first selection criteria. They quickly converge to the Pareto optimal solutions which are easy to find and therefore lose diversity in the decision space. That is, such an MMOP features an imbalance between achieving convergence and preserving diversity in the decision space. This talk discusses a set of imbalanced distance minimization benchmark problems and a novel evolutionary algorithm to solve these problems.
