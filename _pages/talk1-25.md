    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Flexible piezoelectric energy harvester is a thin-film energy harvester with a laminated structure, which is composed of flexible piezoelectric material attached to a flexible substrate. It is used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy so as to power wearable, portable electronic equipment or wireless sensors. However, from an application point of view, low power output and insufficient sensitivity to environmental changes are the main obstacles hindering the widespread application of current energy harvesters in engineering practice. Using limited space to design a structure with large deformability to convert low-frequency vibration into electrical energy to the maximum extent is an effective way to increase the output power of the flexible piezoelectric energy harvester. Therefore, this paper provided a flexible piezoelectric energy harvester based on a corrugated structure to improve its environmental sensitivity and output power. Combining Euler- Bernoulli beam theory and D'Alembert principle, the differential dynamic equation of the corrugated energy harvester is derived where the excitation mode of axial load under the initial defect is considered. Analytical solutions of voltage amplitude and average power is obtained using Rayleigh– Ritz method. Then the influence of excitation frequency and load resistance on the output voltage of the corrugated piezoelectric energy harvesting device is studied through numerical simulation. It can be concluded that the effect of the corrugated flexible energy harvester will be significantly improved when the frequency is around 20-25Hz with load resistance of 106Ω. Finally, a prototype of the corrugated piezoelectric energy harvesting device was made and its output performance was tested. The experimental results are basically consistent with the simulation results.
