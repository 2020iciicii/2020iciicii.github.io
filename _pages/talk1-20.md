    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) has been proposed as an emerging and promising approach to facilitating collaboration. It utilizes roles as underlying mechanisms to support collaboration by taking advantage of roles. It is divided into several phases: role negotiation, role assignment, and role play.
    </p>
    <p>
Role assignment can be categorized into three phases: agent evaluation, group role assignment, and role transfer. Agent evaluation rates the qualification of an agent for a role. It requires a check on the capabilities, experiences, and credits of agents based on role specifications. Qualifications are the basic requirements for possible role-related activities. It is a fundamental yet difficult problem that requires advanced methodologies, such as information classification, data mining, pattern search, and match. Group role assignment (GRA) initiates a group by assigning roles to its members or agents to achieve its highest performance. Administrators must conduct it by thinking of the issues brought in by the assignment.
     </p>
     <p>
In dealing with GRA, there are many constraints we need to consider. These constraints come from future role execution, including conflicts, cooperation, limitations, preferences, and feasibility. Solutions to the GRA with constraints (GRA+) problems can be more easily applied to industrial applications. After more constraints are discussed, multiple objective problems are revealed for GRA and GRA+. Such problems are called GRA with Multiple Objectives (GRA++)
This talk introduces the concepts of Role-Based Collaboration and the E-CARGO (Environment
– Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects) model, clarifies the group role assignment problems (GRA, GRA+, and GRA++) by examples and formalizations, discusses the solutions, and presents the recent research results.
