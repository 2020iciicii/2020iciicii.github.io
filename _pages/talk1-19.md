    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Smart materials can transform magnetic, electric and thermal energy into mechanical energy, which is based on varied physical effects within the materials, such as magnetic-mechanical materials (magnetostrictive effect), electric-mechanical materials (piezoelectric effect), thermal-mechanical materials (shape memory effect) and so on, showing very broad applications in actuators (micro/nano positioning) and transducers (sensors and ultrasonic devices). Here two applications will be introduced related with smart materials and actuators. First case is the deep hole with small diameter on hard materials machined by EDM which is assisted by ulrasonic devices, showing the process with high efficiency and surface quality. Another one shows a specific micro/nano positioning device cosisted with two smart actuators combined with multifuctional compliant mechnism. Compared with traditional actuators, smart actuators show extraordinary characteristics in some specific applications.
