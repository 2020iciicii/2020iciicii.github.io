    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Due to the complicated motion control issues caused by under-actuation, high-dimension nonlinearity, uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics, and interactions with complex environments of the snake robots, it makes snake robots gain high efficiency, athletic agility, and environmental adaptability of natural snakes being a challenging problem. In this talk, towards an effective solution/framework for dealing with the efficient movement of a class of underactuated snake robots, we propose a generic adaptive control and path following strategy for motion control of such robots with uncertain kinematics and dynamics. Utilizing this strategy, several advanced path following tasks for a class of underactuated multi-segment snake-like robots were successfully implemented and will be presented. Extensive simulation and experimental results will be further demonstrated to validate that the controlled robots can improve mobility and path following capability on the varied ground environments, which advances the steps for snake robots to be applied in real-world applications.
