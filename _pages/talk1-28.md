    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
In the general trend of turning things into smart state, it comes natural to envision clothing to become smart(er) some day in the (near?) future. Unlike many other gadgets that are not attached to human body, design and fabrication of smart clothing is evidently burdened with the fact that the electronics has to be integrated with clothing in a way that does not make the garment unpleasant for wearing. Early commercial solutions up to date, have mainly been oriented towards fitness monitoring applications and sensor communication with a userâ€™s mobile phone. Within this research, we like to think of the solution as having voice communication possibility, too, and without the dependence on the mobile phone, which brings a significant challenge to the possible solution. In this talk, we will discuss the main components that constitute the prospective complete solution. In addition, discussion will point to some details that make the solution harder to achieve.

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
Prof. Miroslav Joler received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Zagreb, Croatia, in 1996, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA, in 2001 and 2006, respectively. In 2006, he was a postdoctoral research associate with Portland State University, Portland, OR, USA. In 2007, he joined the University of Rijeka, Croatia, where he has founded a Wireless Communications Lab, and served as Chair of Computer Engineering Department, amongst other duties. His industry experience includes a position of an RF engineer with Croatian Radio and Television from 1996 to 1999. He has published in prominent scientific journals and served as session (co)chair, and technical program committee member at international conferences. He is an Editorial Board Member of two international scientific publishers and an Associate Editor of an international scientific journal. In 2017, he was elected to Associate level of Croatian Academy of Engineering. His current research interests include development of smart clothing, wearable and reconfigurable systems, biomedical applications of electromagnetics, and wireless power transfer.
