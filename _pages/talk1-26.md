    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
   Ultrasonic motors convert electrical energy into kinetic energy on the basis of inverse piezoelectric effect and achieve actuation via frictional force. Compared to electromagnetic motors, they exhibit quick response, self-locking at the power-off state, and absence of electromagnetic radiation. Recently, ultrasonic motors with lightweight have become increasingly required in the fields of robotics and precision machines. To reduce the weight of ultrasonic motors, two methods, namely usage of functional materials and structural design of triple-layered transducers, were exploited in our previous studies. First, it is known that polymers exhibit low density but high attenuation for ultrasounds. However, it is interesting to find that poly phenylene sulfide is capable of providing far lower attenuation than commonly-used polymeric materials; this property implies the potential applicability of poly phenylene sulfide as the vibrating materials of ultrasonic motors. Through experimental investigation, we found that the weight was 0.3 times lower for the poly phenylene sulfide-based than for the aluminum-based ultrasonic motor when they had identical structures and provided approximately the same output power. This result verifies that using polymer vibrating bodies is an effective approach to decrease ultrasonic motors’ weights. Second, to obtain sufficiently high stiffness, the thickness should be satisfactorily large for ultrasonic motors; this problem obstructs the reduction in weight. To tackle this problem, a triple-layered transducer; incorporating a fine-ceramic layer, a metallic layer, and a piezoelectric-ceramic layer; was devised to drive ultrasonic motors. Here, owing to the high elastic modulus, the fine-ceramic layer can greatly increase the stiffness despite its low thickness. The metallic layer is utilized as the surface in contact with the rotor because it has good workability. The entire transducer is excited with the piezoelectric- ceramic layer. The experimental result shows that, using this transducer, the ultrasonic motor’s weight is decreased to 0.4 times of its original weight; this indicates the feasibility of weight reduction through structural design. To sum up, two approaches to reduce ultrasonic motors’ weights were developed and their effectiveness was experimentally validated. Meanwhile, this study provides a new way for weight reduction and would contribute to improving the practicality of ultrasonic motors.
